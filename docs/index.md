**SRTsim** is an independent, reproducible, and flexible SRT simulation framework that can be used to facilitate the development of SRT analytical methods for a wide variety of SRT-specific analyses. It utilizes spatial localization information to simulate SRT expression count data in a reproducible and scalable fashion. Two major simulation schemes are implemented in SRTsim: reference-based and reference-free.
